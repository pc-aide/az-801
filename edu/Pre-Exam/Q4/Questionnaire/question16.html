      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
      <p>Yes, you need to change the port as Azure App Service wouldn’t accept anything other than 80/443, and also anonymous authentication is on by default. Additionally, without a custom domain and certificate, the migration would involve significant changes. Azure App Service can handle security certificates, but the Migration Assistant won’t migrate the certificate automatically for you. After migration, you need to add a custom domain and configure the certificate.</p>
