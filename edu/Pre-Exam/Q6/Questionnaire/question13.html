  <h2>Question 13</h2>
  <p>You have three servers named Server1, Server2, and Server3 that run Windows Server. The servers have the Hyper-V server role installed and are configured in a Storage Spaces Direct cluster named Cluster1.<br/><br/>
  Cluster1 hosts a virtual machine named VM1 that has Windows Admin Center installed.<br/><br/>
  You manage all servers and clusters by using Windows Admin Center.<br/><br/>
  You purchase an Azure subscription.<br/><br/>
  You need to configure email alerts in Azure Monitor for the following:<br/><br/>
  ✑ Disk Capacity Utilization Over 80 % for 10 Minutes<br/>
  ✑ Any critical alert in the cluster system event log<br/>
  ✑ Memory Utilization over 95 % for 10 Minutes<br/>
  ✑ Heartbeat fewer than 5 beats for 5 Minutes<br/>
  ✑ CPU Utilization over 85 % for 10 Minutes<br/>
  ✑ Any health service faults for the cluster<br/><br/>
  The solution must use the minimum amount of administrative effort.<br/><br/>
  What should you do?</p>

    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>A question which won't age well. MMA via WAC's Azure Monitor for VMs (Insights) does support all the requirements and doesn't need Arc & AMA separately deploying, so is a valid option at the time the question was written (noting least administrative overhead), but given MMA has a finite life (Aug 2024), the only recommended method will soon fall back to 'A'</p>
