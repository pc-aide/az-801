  <h2>Question 3</h2>
  <p>You have a Site-to-Site VPN between an on-premises network and an Azure VPN gateway. BGP is disabled for the Site-to-Site VPN.<br/><br/>You have an Azure virtual network named Vnet1 that contains a subnet named Subnet1. Subnet1 contains a virtual machine named Server1. You can connect to Server1 from the on-premises network.<br/><br/>You extend the address space of Vnet1. You add a subnet named Subnet2 to Vnet1. Subnet2 uses the extended address space. You deploy an Azure virtual machine named Server2 to Subnet2.<br/><br/>You cannot connect to Server2 from the on-premises network. Server1 can connect to Server2.<br/><br/>You need to ensure that you can connect to Subnet2 from the on-premises network. What should you do?</p>

  <div id="solutionInfo_question3" class="solutionInfo" style="display: none;">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>By default, Azure VPN gateway advertises the virtual network address space to the on-premises VPN device using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). However, in this scenario, BGP is disabled for the Site-to-Site VPN. Therefore, you need to manually update the on-premises VPN device with the new extended address space of Vnet1 and create a new route for it.</p>
