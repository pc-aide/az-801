        <h2>Question 4</h2>
        <p>You have a failover cluster named Cluster1 that hosts an application named App1.</p>
        <p>The General tab in App1 Properties is shown in the General exhibit.</p>
        <p>The Failover tab in App1 Properties is shown in the Failover exhibit.</p>
        <p>Server1 shuts down unexpectedly. You need to ensure that when you start Server1, App1 continues to run on Server2.</p>
        <p>Solution: From the General settings, you increase the priority of Server2 in the Preferred Owners list. Does this meet the goal?</p>
        
        <div class="radio-group">
            <input type="radio" id="q4a" name="solution" value="A">
            <label for="q4a">A. Yes</label><br>
            <input type="radio" id="q4b" name="solution" value="B">
            <label for="q4b">B. No</label><br>
        </div>

        <button class="solutionButton" data-answer-name="question4">Solution</button>

        <div id="solutionInfo_question4" class="solutionInfo" style="display: none;">
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Even if the priority of server 2 is increased, this will have no effect because there are no servers marked as preferred owner. The correct answer is B --> NO. If unticked would have worked with these settings “immediately fallback” and node 1 mentioned on top it would have been running on node 1. But it runs on node 2 as the preferred owner list works only when ticked.</p>
