    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>The Azure Performance Diagnostics extension is a powerful tool for diagnosing and identifying performance issues with Azure VMs. It allows you to gather a wide range of performance data, including network traces, which can be invaluable in situations where you suspect networking issues. Configuring Performance Diagnostics on VM1 through the Azure portal will enable you to collect the necessary data to understand what's causing the application to become unresponsive.</p>
