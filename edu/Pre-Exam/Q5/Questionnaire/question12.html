  <h2>Question 12</h2>
  <p>You have a failover cluster named Cluster1 that contains four Windows Server nodes named Node1, Node2, Node3, and Node4.</p>
  <p>You need to deploy a Storage Spaces Direct virtual disk to Cluster1.</p>
  <p>You add the following disks to each node:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Three 512-GB NVMe disks</li>
    <li>Three 3-TB HDD disks</li>
    <li>Three 1-TB SSD disks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>On Cluster1, you enable Storage Spaces Direct and add the new disks.</p>
  <p>What is the total amount of disk space available for the Storage Spaces Direct virtual disk, and which operations are cached for the SSD and HDD disks? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.</p>

  <div id="solutionInfo_question12" class="solutionInfo" style="display: none;">
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>The setup includes NVMe disks as cache, SSDs as capacity, and HDDs as additional capacity. According to the configuration, the total disk space available for the Storage Spaces Direct virtual disk is 48 TB. SSDs cache read and write operations, while HDDs cache read and write operations as well.</p>
