  <h2>Question 3</h2>
  <p>Your on-premises network has a 200-Mbps connection to Azure and contains a server named Server1 that stores 70 TB of data files. You have an Azure Storage account named storage1. You plan to migrate the data files from Server1 to a blob storage container in storage1. Testing shows that copying the data files by using azcopy will take approximately 35 days. You need to minimize how long it will take to migrate the data to Azure. What should you use?</p>

    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>The Microsoft Azure Data Box cloud solution lets you send terabytes of data into and out of Azure in a quick, inexpensive, and reliable way. The secure data transfer is accelerated by shipping you a proprietary Data Box storage device. Each storage device has a maximum usable storage capacity of 80 TB and is transported to your datacenter through a regional carrier. The device has a rugged casing to protect and secure data during the transit.</p>
