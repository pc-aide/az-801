  <h2>Question 19</h2>
  <p>Your on-premises network contains two subnets. The subnets contain servers that run Windows Server as shown in the following table:</p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>IP address</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Server1</td><td>192.168.1.10</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Server2</td><td>192.168.2.50</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Server3</td><td>192.168.0.240</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Server4</td><td>192.168.0.10</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>Server4 has the following IP configurations:</p>
  <p>Ethernet adapter Ethernet:<br>
     Connection-specific DNS Suffix . . :<br>
     IPv4 Address . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.10<br>
     Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0<br>
     Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1
  </p>
  <p>From Server4, you can ping Server1 and Server2 successfully. When you ping Server3, you get a Request timed out response.<br>
  From Server2, you can ping Server1 and Server3 successfully.</p>
  <p>The misconfiguration of which component on Server3 can cause the Request timed out response?</p>

    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <p>The key here is we're told what works and what doesnâ€™t:<br>
    S2 can ping to S1<br>
    S2 can ping to S3 implies S2 and S3 are indeed on the same subnet<br>
    S4 can ping to S1<br>
    S4 can ping to S2<br>
    but S4 CANNOT ping S3 even though they should be on the same subnet<br>
    Question implies a /24 mask is (or should be) in use for all since we're told there are "two subnets". 192.168.1.0/24 would cover S1 address, and 192.168.0.0/24 would cover S2/S3/S4.<br>
    But if S3 had a /26 mask.. 255.255.255.192, it would cause ONLY S2 and S3 to be on the same network. Since S4's fourth octet is so far away, it would be on a different subnet IF the /26 mask was in use.</p>
