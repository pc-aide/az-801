        <h2>Question 17</h2>
        <p>You have a server that runs Windows Server. The server is configured to encrypt all incoming traffic by using a connection security rule.</p>
        <p>You need to ensure that Server1 can respond to the unencrypted tracert commands initiated from computers on the same network.</p>
        <p>What should you do from Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security?</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
            <p>IPSec exemptions change Exempt ICMP from IPSec to Yes. Use this setting to prevent ICMP (Ping and Tracert) messages from being authenticated, encrypted, or both. Keeping ICMP messages unprotected allows you to perform basic network troubleshooting when IPSec cannot be successfully negotiated.</p>
