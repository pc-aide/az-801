|9|NLB|Network Load Balancing<br/><br/>NLB in Azure is a service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple virtual machines (VMs) or services to ensure high availability and reliability of applications. NLB operates at the network layer (Layer 4) and uses load-balancing algorithms to route client requests efficiently, balancing the load and preventing any single VM from becoming overwhelmed.

Azure's NLB supports both TCP and UDP protocols and can be configured for public or internal load balancing scenarios.|
