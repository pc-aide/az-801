|9|NLB|Network Load Balancing<br/><br/>NLB in Azure is a service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple virtual machines (VMs) or services to ensure high availability and reliability of applications. NLB operates at the network layer (Layer 4) and uses load-balancing algorithms to route client requests efficiently, balancing the load and preventing any single VM from becoming overwhelmed. This helps to improve the performance and availability of applications by spreading the workload evenly across the resources. Azure's NLB supports both TCP and UDP protocols and can be configured for public or internal load balancing scenarios.|

|15|SLB|Software Load Balancer<br/><br/>In Azure, a Software Load Balancer (SLB) is a fully managed, scalable, and highly available load balancing service that distributes incoming traffic among multiple virtual machines (VMs) within a virtual network. SLB operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and uses advanced algorithms to ensure efficient traffic distribution, improving application availability and responsiveness. It supports both TCP and UDP protocols and can handle both inbound and outbound scenarios. SLB is designed to provide fault tolerance, seamless scaling, and high performance for cloud-based applications, ensuring that no single VM is overwhelmed by traffic. It is often used for load balancing internal services and applications within an Azure Virtual Network.|
